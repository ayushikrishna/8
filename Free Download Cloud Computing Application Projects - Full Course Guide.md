## What You'll Learn in This Free Cloud Computing Course

This comprehensive course is structured to guide you through the entire process of developing and deploying cloud applications, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Here's a glimpse of what you'll learn:

*   **Cloud Computing Fundamentals:** Gain a solid understanding of cloud computing concepts, including different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and key benefits like scalability, elasticity, and cost optimization.

*   **Introduction to Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):** Explore the leading cloud platforms â€“ Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Weâ€™ll cover their core services, pricing models, and how to choose the right platform for your needs.

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:** Learn how to automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. This powerful tool allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it repeatable, version-controlled, and easy to manage.

*   **Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes:** Discover the power of containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. Learn how to package your applications into portable containers, deploy them to a cluster, and manage their lifecycle efficiently.

*   **Serverless Computing with AWS Lambda and Azure Functions:** Explore the world of serverless computing, where you can run your code without managing servers. Weâ€™ll cover AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, and show you how to build scalable and cost-effective applications.

*   **Database Management in the Cloud (RDS, DynamoDB, Cosmos DB):** Learn how to manage databases in the cloud using managed services like Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and Azure Cosmos DB. Weâ€™ll cover database design principles, performance optimization, and data security in the cloud.

*   **Building and Deploying Web Applications to the Cloud:** Walk through the process of building and deploying web applications to the cloud. Weâ€™ll cover different architectures, deployment strategies, and best practices for building scalable and reliable web applications.

*   **Monitoring and Logging in the Cloud:** Learn how to monitor your applications and infrastructure in the cloud using tools like CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Stackdriver. Weâ€™ll cover log management, performance monitoring, and alerting.

*   **Cloud Security Best Practices:** Understand the importance of cloud security and learn how to protect your applications and data in the cloud. Weâ€™ll cover identity and access management, network security, data encryption, and compliance.

*   **Hands-On Projects:** Put your knowledge into practice with a series of hands-on projects that simulate real-world cloud computing scenarios. These projects will help you build confidence and develop practical skills that you can apply to your own projects.
