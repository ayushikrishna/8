## What is Configuration Manager 2016 (SCCM)? Why Learn It?

Configuration Manager 2016, at its heart, is a **systems management software product** developed by Microsoft. While newer versions exist, a foundational understanding of ConfigMgr 2016 provides a solid base for understanding subsequent iterations. Itâ€™s designed to manage large groups of computers running Windows NT, Windows Embedded, macOS, Linux, and Unix, as well as mobile devices (though device management has largely shifted to Intune in newer deployments).
